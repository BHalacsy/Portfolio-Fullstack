            <span class="text-2xl font-semibold">About me</span>
            <p class="text-sm mt-5 font-light text-justify">
                A brief intro about me and who I am?
                I am an American/Hungarian student at <a href="https://vu.nl/nl" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="link-text">Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam</a>,
                completing a bachelor's degree in Computer Science.
                I have a deep interest in computer systems and would like to focus on backend and low level software engineering.
                With a foundation of theoretical knowledge and practical hands-on experience, I am seeking to launch my professional career in the field I have now spent a large part of my life working towards.
                Looking to work on real-world software that could impact millions of peoples day to day lives with the code I produce. This ambition to make a serious impact is what drives my interests in software design and development.
            </p>
            <p class="text-sm mt-5 font-light text-justify">
                The very first time I fell in love with computer science was actually in middle school. During our once a week IT class we got introduced to the concept of algorithms, the logical structure of these algorithms made
                sense to me at a time in my life when natural language was difficult as a bilingual child transitioning to a Hungarian school.
                This inturn introduced me to "technically" my first programming language, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_graphics" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="link-text">Logo</a> in which we guided a turtle
                to draw on a canvas. This very simple algorithm was the pandora's box that had started it all.
            </p>
            <p class="text-sm mt-5 font-light text-justify">
                By the time I had to transition to high school I knew I had wanted to work with computers when I had grown up.
                I had made the decision to enroll in a vocational high school focusing on information technology, here we had fewer classes regarding things such as geography and biology,
                more so computer programming (C#) and computer networks (Cisco Packet tracer).
                This set in stone what I was going to do later on in my professional career and looking back it was the best decision I had made as it not just fueled my existing passion for computers,
                but also brought me close to like-minded individuals who I now call my friends.
                Here I gained a foundational understanding on how computers are built, operate and communicate, however this was just scratching the surface of what was to come.
            </p>
            <p class="text-sm mt-5 font-light text-justify">
                I always knew following high school that I would want to continue my studies in English as opposed to Hungarian.
                So the decision to study abroad was a no-brainer considering all the options out there for studying computer science. I eventually landed on wanting to study in the Netherlands as it is considered to be a tech hub of Europe and made the decision to enroll at the VU.
                Here I could easily pick up and understand the curriculum as I had previous experience with computers and programming, however it is challenging enough to deepen my knowledge of computer systems.
                of my favourite courses were: Machine learning, Software development and Computer networks.
                I am currently in my last year of this bachelor's program and grinding to land an internship to gain work experience before ending my time here at university.
            </p>
            <p class="text-sm mt-5 font-light text-justify">
                I am now just focusing on projects that could improve my CV in hopes of finally landing an internship, so I may get some real-world hands-on experience in a field I have been striving to join since middle school.

                in-memory key value store database known for its high performance and low latency which supports advanced data types such as sets, lists, hashes and more.
                Using for a variety of things but typically as a cache for large scale databases alongside real-time analytics and pub/sub messaging.

            </p>
            <p class="text-sm mt-5 font-light text-justify">
                I knew that for my very first independent project I wanted to make some existing piece of software and understand its inner workings.
                Initially I considered following one of code crafters' challenges since they provide a bit more hand holding and have automated tests indicating if you complete a subsection of the challenger,
                however seeing how much it would cost for a subscription, I have opted to instead have no hand holding and do the tests myself.
            </p>
            <p class="text-sm mt-5 font-light text-justify">
                I began by deciding what language to write the clone in. C++ seemed like an ideal choice as I have had plenty of experience using it, and it is closely related to C in which the original Redis is written in.
                Once that was done I made sure to set up a GitHub Actions workflow to run any existing tests automatically on pushes to the repo.
                Having experience with computer networks came in handy since I had to use linux's sockets, encode and parse commands using RESP and have done multithreaded programming multiple times.
                I began by converting existing code (server and client) done in python to C++ which proved to be more of a challenge than I had thought, but once echo message was set up, it was time to get our hands dirty.
            </p>
            <p class="text-sm mt-5 font-light text-justify">
                Following this I wanted to follow Redis' RESProtocol for communication as it proved all the utility I had wanted for my clone.
                Initially only allowed to store strings with the basic commands (SET, GET, DEL, EXISTS) I added the first feature of the clone, key expiration.
                I expanded by implementing advanced data structure and their respective commands.
                This had set up the core functionality of the Redis clone, however we were far from done.
            </p>
            <p class="text-sm mt-5 font-light text-justify">
                Having had worked with multithreading I decided that a thread pool would be fitting for our application to allow concurrent access to the database, this came with its own challenge of handling
                race condition in case multiple threads try to access the same piece of memory. The easy fix for this was to thread lock the kv store in memory when a thread tries to access it, however this
                greatly impacted performance and made accessing the database incredibly slow. I solved this by using TBB's fine-grain locking in which we only lock the currently accessed portion of the kv store
                as opposed to the entire db.
            </p>
            <p class="text-sm mt-5 font-light text-justify">
                Another feature I knew I wanted to implement was snapshotting as this allowed for the kv store to remain persistent.
                To do this I utilized Boost's serialization which made serializing the kv store much easier as I was using custom data types for managing kv pairs.
                Other features included Pub/Sub messaging, Pipelining, Transaction support for command queueing and LRU (Least Recently Used) key eviction for memory management.
            </p>
            <p class="text-sm mt-5 font-light text-justify">
                Having all these features I had a pretty deep understanding of Redis core functionality, however I always want to make software which has some sort of real world use.
                I decided to dockerize the Redis clone in hopes of running it as a database for a project down the line. As you can imagine I had some ideas, in fact, it runs the very website you are reading this on.

            <p class="text-sm mt-5 font-light text-justify">
                The website you are currently reading this on is actually the project I am going to talk about next.
                I figured after I had finished my <a href="#projRedis" class="link-text">Redis clone</a> that I should use for a real world application to show its functionality in practice.
                Having your very own website always was appealing, so when the opportunity came around to utilize my previous project in a way that can be viewed by anyone, it was really a no-brainer.
            </p>
            <p class="text-sm mt-5 font-light text-justify">
                Now having a database or even a backend is not necessary for a web portfolio, but as someone who inspires to be a future software engineer
                I figured I should get a taste of full-stack web development sooner rather than later.
                Three features came to mind that could utilize my db in one way or another, a page view counter and an anonymous chatroom alongside the collaborative canvas you can find in the <a href="#toybox">toybox</a>.
            </p>
            <p class="text-sm mt-5 font-light text-justify">
                Once my stack and features were chosen I began really understanding how API endpoints work and focused solely at first on the backend with a very minimal frontend structure.
                As someone who aspires to become a backend developer, I was eager to begin with that so my development started from back to front.
                ASP.NET's minimal api made it a breeze to set up the various endpoints needed to communicate with my db, once that communication was established it was time for some frontend development.
            </p>
            <p class="text-sm mt-5 font-light text-justify">
                I initially considered using a framework like <a href="https://react.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="link-text">React</a> but opted not to as I figured a project with this "relatively" small scale was not necessary,
                I would later come to regret this decision as it would have familiarized myself with a widely used web framework.
                No matter, using vanilla TS was sufficient and forced me to utilize more traditional frontend techniques which is always a good skill to have.
            </p>
            <p class="text-sm mt-5 font-light text-justify">
                The very first feature and easiest was the view counter as it only increments a single number in our db on an API call.
                For the rest of the features I could not say the same, the collaborative canvas especially was a challenge and forced me to reconsider the design I had in mind.
                Due to the large amount of data we want to save and load at any given time, I opted to "chunk" the canvas into tiles for saving and into sub-strokes for real-time visualizing for other clients.
            </p>
            <p class="text-sm mt-5 font-light text-justify">
                As for frontend design choices I always consider a relatively clean and smooth look.
                Tailwind simplified the styling process to a great extent and is definitely a tool I will utilize in the future provided I work with HTML again.
                I knew I wanted a single page design with various sections, these sections initially were all one single tile,
                but I had made the decision to tile each div in the sections to get this almost mosaic layout.
            </p>
            <p class="text-sm mt-5 font-light text-justify">
                Frontend plugs also came in handy as I never had experience animating elements on HTML,
                decided to use <a href="https://rombo.co/tailwind/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="link-text">Rombo</a> which is a sleek and easy to use plugin just for that.
                Having these springy, blurry and sleek animations was nice, but always ran when the page had loaded which defeated their purpose, as the user would never see them.
                I always knew about the Intersect Observer API but setting it up seemed like a challenge,
                therefore I utilized an existing <a href="https://github.com/heidkaemper/tailwindcss-intersect" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="link-text">tailwind-intersect</a> plugin
                which did the very same task but much easier to implement.
                Along with some subtle animations on hover and a simple overhead menu with dark mode and casual music options, I reckon this website turned out alright.
            </p>
            <p class="text-sm mt-5 font-light text-justify">
                Deployment also came with its own challenges. I knew I could run the websites backend using a NAS that our family has and on it, I ran the backend, the Redis clone and a cloudflare tunnel, so
                I wouldn't need to forward any ports and keep a high level of security for our local network. My main subdomain is used to connect the user to this page, while an api.halacsy.com domain is made to route to the NAS for api calls.
                All of these built together and managed on a docker compose file for quick build up and tear down of the website.

                A lot of question arouse when picking the idle stack for my portfolio.
                I ended up sticking with vanilla <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="link-text">typescript</a> as opposed to using a framework,
                as I wanted to refresh my knowledge of javascript with the benefit of a strongly typed language.<br>
                Along with TS for the frontend I opted to use <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="link-text">tailwind</a> for styling,
                as I did not mind the added clutter it adds to my html file if it meant a simplified way of styling. Along with some useful plugins that I will talk about in the description.
            </p>
            <p class="text-sm mt-5 font-light text-justify">
                For the backend I chose <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="link-text">ASP.NET</a> as I have plenty C# experience. With all the possible backend frameworks I figured using one which I will have no problem coding in will work just fine.
                Even though I did not utilize the MVC architecture and instead relied on a minimal API style, the option to pivot was always there if I wanted to.<br>
                The database for the website is my Redis clone containerized alongside the backend of the website using <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/" target="blank" rel="noopener" class="link-text">docker compose</a>, both of which are running on a NAS.
